# BackLun
## Universal backend server
### Description
Backlun — a set of various Back-end services (platforms) with a API, but missing the Front-end. You can create any Front-end using any framework, libraries, JS dialects.

#### Why?
Backlun will be useful for Front-end developers who are not familiar with Back-end development, but who want to create a Front-end for a real dynamic application. Backlun is suitable for developers who want to try out a new Front-end framework, but do not want to create a back-end part of the application for this. Backlun is a good choice for an employer who wants to test the knowledge of a hired Front-end developer.

#### Examples of using
You want to learn how to write a frontend on a TypeScript or ELM. You read the React tutorial and want to write the first practical application. You want to hire a new developer, but he previously made only static pages and you want to test his ability to create an application that interacts with the server through API.
